I share the source under suggestion because my time to work on it is very limited now .. the shared source is a beta of version 1.5, not finished, with bugs already fixed and with the following intentions:
- finish the "messages" system to allow simple translation
- add a "works" system with both vanilla and pixelmon dedicated works
- obtain from this plugin an updated version of "Magma Economy Bridge", lite version that is not a complete economy but only a "bridge" between vault and pixelmon economy

these are my good intentions, you are free to add other functions, streamline the code, use it to create other plugins (as long as they are distributed for free).
good coding




# MagmaEconomy-
As I promised, here is the first (and only?) Plugin for spigot / magma that replicates the famous plugin for sponge (EconomyBridge).   Finally from today the pixelmon economy will communicate with any with this vault-compatible economy and consequently with every vault-compatible plugin! Obviously the plugin is vault and pixelmon dependent. Permissions and guidance on the use of commands are available directly in the plugin config file, after installation! for more info do not hesitate to contact me on my discord group:  https://discord.gg/K4pzvEhncw
